# [yoxisem544.github.io](https://yoxisem544.github.io)

My personal blog. Forked from [overreacted.io by Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io). Syntax theme based on [Nord - An arctic, north-bluish color palette.](https://www.nordtheme.com) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
